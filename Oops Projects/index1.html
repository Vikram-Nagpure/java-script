<!-- ***Explaination*** -->


<!-- =>  We define a class named Animal with a constructor that accepts a name parameter.

=>  We define a class named Dog that extends Animal.

=>  We define a speak method in the Dog class that overrides the speak method in the Animal class.

=>  We create an instance of the Dog class and call the speak method.

=>  The speak method in the Dog class is called, and the output is "Buddy barks." -->
